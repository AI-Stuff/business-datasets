##### Instead of "watching"  you can **join** the link-letter, it's already being sent out to about 90 people and you are free to join too. I will start sending it out to the public by November 2019. The letter includes unique datasets. Monthly link-sharing list: https://mailchi.mp/ec4942d52cc5/firmai.

Due to how nicely they present it, I prefer Kaggle to host my data; they also offer an API interface.
